# Trip-Track
TripTrack is a comprehensive travel logging application for Android, designed to help users seamlessly record and manage their trips. Architected using Kotlin with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, the app is built to be scalable, testable, and maintainable. It leverages the latest Jetpack libraries to provide a robust and intuitive user experience.

Key Features:
• Modern & Reactive UI: A fully declarative UI built with Jetpack Compose, featuring a clean design that reacts to state changes from the ViewModel.
• Efficient Asynchronous Operations: All background tasks, such as network calls and data handling, are managed efficiently using Kotlin Coroutines to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience without blocking the main thread.
• Flexible Authentication: Secure user sign-in and registration using Firebase Authentication, with support for multiple providers including Google, Facebook, and email.
• Real-time Data Sync: Trip data is stored and synchronized in real-time using Cloud Firestore, allowing for a consistent experience across devices.
• User-Centric Design: Includes features like a dynamic light/dark theme toggle and clear navigation, prioritizing user comfort and accessibility.
